# DSA Practice

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice**, currently focusing on **graph traversal algorithms**.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Traverses graphs level by level.
- Supports **adjacency list**.
- Works for **directed** and **undirected** graphs.

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Traverses graphs depth-wise.
- Supports **recursive**.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
